# Contributing to TTB

## Folder Format
- Blocks: `block/<block>/`
- Items: `item/<item>/`
- Entities: `entity/<entity>/`
- World Gen: `world/`
- Debug: `debug/`

## File Format
- All functions that create something (such as summoning a custom block's armour stand, setting it up, etc) should be called `create.mcfunction`
- All functions that remove something (such as removing a custom block's armour stand, spawning its drops, etc) should be called `remove.mcfunction`
- All commands to run on load should be ran in `ttb:load`, apart from special cases or where a function is used in multiple places otherwise
- All sub-folders of `block/`, `entity/`, or similar, should be their full id (e.g. `/block/tempite_stone/` or `/block/acronite_cage/`)
- Anything that runs every tick should be called `tick.mcfunction`
- Anything that runs on a clock should be called `clock<timeframe><timetype>.mcfunction` (e.g. `clock2s` or `clock16t`)

## Naming and Tagging Formatting
- NBT and entity tags should be prefixed with `ttb`
    - `stick{ttb:{item:'my_fancy_stick'}}`
    - `@a[tag=ttb_epic_players]`
- Similarly, all files should be in the `ttb` namespace, such that they can be called by, for example, `ttb:function` or `ttb:advancement`
- Any 'technical' entity (meaning the name will never be seen by the player, such as machines) should have its `CustomName` set as its major tag. For example: `ttb_tempest_crafter`
- All visible text (names, lore, actionbar, advancements) should use translation keys
    - `{"translate":"block.ttb.tempest_crafter"}`
    - `{"translate":"item.ttb.amethyst"}`
- Any custom entity (e.g. custom crafters, mobs & area effect clouds) should have the `ttb_entity` tag
- Tags themselves should be as verbose as possible

## Custom Item Loot Table Format
TTB adopts the format of using loot tables to register custom items. This means that they can be called upon from one source, registered at `ttb:items/<item>`. See `ttb_data/data/ttb/loot_tables/items` for examples.  
To clarify, `ttb:blocks/<block>` holds custom block loot tables, called by their `remove` or `drop` function. These, most often, call upon [loot table items](#Other-loot-tables).
### Accessing loot table items
You can access a loot table item through:

#### /loot
```mcfunction
loot spawn ~ ~ ~ loot ttb:items/<item>
loot give <entity> loot ttb:items/<item>
loot replace ... <slot> loot ttb:items/<item>
```

#### Other loot tables
```json
{
    "type": "minecraft:loot_table",
    "name": "ttb:items/<item>"
}
```
