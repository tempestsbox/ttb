The Tempest's Box adds countless features to the game, providing you with many new items, blocks, entities, structures, and more!  
This project is an update of [Zoey's](https://tempestsbox.github.io/faq#who-is-zoey) TTB for 1.16+, and, just like classic TTB, we want you as involved as possible with the project!

### Troubleshooting and Reporting Issues
Before reporting: Try if you can reproduce your issue when using a freshly setup world using the latest version of Minecraft in vanilla, TTB (with default configuration), and no other data packs. This can already give insights on whether your version (TTB actively supports 1.16+) or another data pack is involved in the issue.
When reporting: You can submit a bug report through the [issue tracker](https://github.com/tempestsbox/ttb/issues).
